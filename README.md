# ClaimWise AI

🚀 **Google Cloud BigQuery AI Hackathon Project**

## 📌 Overview

ClaimWise AI is an AI-powered Insurance Claim Assistant that leverages Google Cloud, BigQuery, and Cloud Storage to streamline the traditionally manual and time-consuming claim review process.

Insurance claim adjusters often need to:

* Review lengthy documents and case files
* Analyze photos of damage
* Cross-check information with third-party sources
* Estimate repair costs using rules and past cases

This manual process can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to fraud. ClaimWise AI addresses these challenges by combining document summarization, case retrieval, and image-based fraud detection into a single intelligent assistant.
