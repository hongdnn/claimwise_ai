Claimwise AI

üöÄ Google Cloud BigQuery AI Hackathon Project

üìå Overview

Claimwise AI is an AI-powered Insurance Claim Assistant that leverages Google Cloud, BigQuery, and Cloud Storage to streamline the traditionally manual and time-consuming claim review process.

Insurance claim adjusters often need to:
	‚Ä¢	Review lengthy documents and case files
	‚Ä¢	Analyze photos of damage
	‚Ä¢	Cross-check information with third-party sources
	‚Ä¢	Estimate repair costs using rules and past cases

This manual process can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to fraud. Claimwise AI addresses these challenges by combining document summarization, case retrieval, and image-based fraud detection into a single intelligent assistant.

‚∏ª

‚ú® Key Features
	‚Ä¢	Semantic Claim Retrieval: BigQuery Vector Search on text embeddings to retrieve similar past cases for faster, more accurate cost estimation. 
	‚Ä¢	Multimodal Fraud Detection: AI embeddings on crash photos stored in Cloud Storage to detect anomalies and identify potential fraud. 
	‚Ä¢	Explainable AI Handling: Standardized AI-driven captions and embeddings ensure consistent, transparent, and auditable claim decisions.
	‚Ä¢	Automated Fraud Flagging - Updates fraud status automatically for high-risk customers
	‚Ä¢	Interactive Analytics - Rich visualizations and comparative analysis tools

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
	‚Ä¢	Cloud Platform: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
	‚Ä¢	Data Storage: Google Cloud Storage & BigQuery
	‚Ä¢	Core Libraries: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib/ Seaborn
